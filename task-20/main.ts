// 20. Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// Example: List of Mountains
let mountains: string[] = [
  'Everest',
  'K2',
  'Denali',
  'Kangchenjunga',
  'Matterhorn',
];

// Print the array
console.log('List of Mountains:', mountains);
